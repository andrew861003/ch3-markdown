# Exercise 2
Using the text-edit of your choice (e.g., Atom), create a new file called `README.md`. Alternatively, you may clone this repository and edit this file.

In your `README.md` document, make a three column table of the current courses you are taking, with separate columns for course number (in **bold**), course title (in _italics_), and instructor name.

| Course number | Course title | Instructor name |
|---|---|---|
|**ACCTG 302**|_Intermediate Accounting II_| D. Shores|
|**FIN 350**|_Business Finance_|Ran Duchin|
|**INFO 201**|_Technical Foundations of Informatics_| Michael Freeman|
|**ITAL 127**|_Survival Italian_| Sabrina Tatta
