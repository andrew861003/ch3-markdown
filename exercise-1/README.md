# Exercise 1
Using the text-edit of your choice (e.g., Atom), create a new file called `README.md`. Alternatively, you may clone this repository and edit this file.

In your `README.md` document, put your favorite quote in a block quote, and provide a link to a website that provides additional information about the quote.

```
Great things in business are never done by one person.
They're done by a team of people. -Steve Jobs
